DftbPlus

Introduction
============

DftbPlus_ is a density-functional baed tight-binding code using
atom-centered orbitals. This interface makes it possible to use DftbPlus_
as a calculator in ASE. You need Slater-Koster files for the combination
of atom types of your system. These can be obtained at dftb.org_.

Environment variables
=====================

Before each DftbPlus calculation, please ensure that the following environment
variables are set. :envvar:`DFTB_PREFIX` should point to the directory
where the Slater-Koster files are kept. :envvar:`DFTB_COMMAND` should
contain the path of the DftbPlus executable. This variable need not be
set if a :envvar:`dftb+` executable can be found in the :envvar:`PATH`.

- bash::

  $ DFTB_PREFIX=/my_disk/my_name/lib/Dftb+sk/mio-0-1/  (an example)
  $ DFTB_COMMAND=~/bin/DFTB+/dftb+_s081217.i686-linux  (an example)

- csh/tcsh::

  $ setenv DFTB_PREFIX /my_disk/my_name/lib/Dftb+sk/mio-0-1/  (an example)
  $ setenv DFTB_COMMAND ~/bin/DFTB+/dftb+_s081217.i686-linux   (an example)


DftbPlus Calculator (a FileIOCalculator)
========================================
The file 'geo_end.gen' contains the input and output geometry
and it will be updated during the DftbPlus calculations.

All keywords to the DftbPlus calculator can be set by ASE.


Parameters
==========
        restart: str (default None)
            If restart == None
            it is assumed that a new input file 'dftb_hsd.in'
            will be written by ase using default keywords
            and the ones given by the user.

            If restart != None
            it is assumed that keywords are in file 'restart'
        ignore_bad_restart_file: bool (default False)
            Ignore broken or missing restart file.  By default, an error
            is raised if restart!=None and the restart file is missing
            or broken.
        label: str (default 'dftb')
            Prefix used for the main output file (<label>.out).
        atoms: Atoms object (default None)
            Optional Atoms object to which the calculator will be attached.
            When restarting, atoms will get its positions and unit cell updated
            from the restart file.
        kpts: (default None)
            Brillouin zone sampling:

            * ``(1,1,1)`` or ``None``: Gamma-point only
            * ``(n1,n2,n3)``: Monkhorst-Pack grid
            * ``dict``: Interpreted as a path in the Brillouin zone if it
              contains the 'path_' keyword. Otherwise it is converted into a
              Monkhorst-Pack grid using ase.calculators.calculator.kpts2sizeandoffsets
            * ``[(k11,k12,k13),(k21,k22,k23),...]``: Explicit (Nkpts x 3) array of k-points
              in units of the reciprocal lattice vectors (each with equal weight)

Example: Geometry Optimization by ASE
=====================================

.. literalinclude:: dftb_ex1_relax.py

Example: Geometry Optimization by DftbPlus
==========================================

.. literalinclude:: dftb_ex2_relaxbyDFTB.py

Example: NVE md followed by NVT md (both by DftbPlus)
=====================================================

This is unphysical because of at least two reasons:

- oxygen does not have spin here
- the Berendsen coupling is too strong (0.01 here should be 0.0001)
