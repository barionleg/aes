# 1. The "can't resolve package" warning is for oldlibs.
# 2. The rm_rf warning is for issue #600.
# 3. There is a problem where filterwarnings=error removes all ResourceWarnings
# in stead of raising them as errors.
# See: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5676
# In stead we do "once" for those warnings.
