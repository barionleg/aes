Molecular dynamics
==================

.. module:: ase.md
   :synopsis: Molecular Dynamics

Typical computer simulations involve moving the atoms around, either
to optimize a structure (energy minimization) or to do molecular
dynamics.  This chapter discusses molecular dynamics, energy
minimization algorithms will be discussed in the :mod:`ase.optimize`
section.

A molecular dynamics object will operate on the atoms by moving them
according to their forces - it integrates Newton's second law
numerically.  A typical molecular dynamics simulation will use the
`Velocity Verlet dynamics`_.  You create the
:class:`ase.md.verlet.VelocityVerlet` object, giving it the atoms and a time
step, and then you perform dynamics by calling its
:meth:`~verlet.VelocityVerlet.run` method::

  dyn = VelocityVerlet(atoms, dt=5.0 * units.fs,
                       trajectory='md.traj', logfile='md.log')
  dyn.run(1000)  # take 1000 steps

A number of algorithms can be used to perform molecular
dynamics, with slightly different results.


.. note::

   Prior to ASE version 3.21.0, inconsistent units were used to
   specify temperature.  Some modules expected kT (in eV), others T
   (in Kelvin).  From ASE 3.21.0, all molecular dynamics modules
   expecting a temperature take a parameter ``temperature_K`` which is
   the temperature in Kelvin.  For compatibility, they still accept
   the ``temperature`` parameter in the same unit as previous versions
   (eV or K), but using the old parameter will issue a warning.



Choosing the time step
======================

All the dynamics objects need a time step.  Choosing it too small will
waste computer time, choosing it too large will make the dynamics
unstable, typically the energy increases dramatically (the system
"blows up").  If the time step is only a little to large, the lack of
energy conservation is most obvious in `Velocity Verlet dynamics`_,
where energy should otherwise be conserved.

Experience has shown that 5 femtoseconds is a good choice for most metallic
systems.  Systems with light atoms (e.g. hydrogen) and/or with strong
bonds (carbon) will need a smaller time step.

All the dynamics objects documented here are sufficiently related to
have the same optimal time step.


File output
===========

The time evolution of the system can be saved in a trajectory file,
by creating a trajectory object, and attaching it to the dynamics
object.  This is documented in the module :mod:`ase.io.trajectory`.
You can attach the trajectory explicitly to the dynamics object, and
you may want to use the optional ``interval`` argument, so every
time step is not written to the file.

Alternatively, you can just use the ``trajectory`` keyword when
instantiating the dynamics object as in the example above. In this
case, a ``loginterval`` keyword may also be supplied to specify the
frequency of writing to the trajectory. The loginterval keyword will
apply to both the trajectory and the logfile.


Logging
=======

A logging mechanism is provided, printing time; total, potential and
kinetic energy; and temperature (calculated from the kinetic energy).
It is enabled by giving the ``logfile`` argument when the dynamics
object is created, ``logfile`` may be an open file, a filename or the
string '-' meaning standard output.  Per default, a line is printed
for each timestep, specifying the ``loginterval`` argument will chance
this to a more reasonable frequency.

The logging can be customized by explicitly attaching a
:class:`MDLogger` object to the dynamics::

  from ase.md import MDLogger
  dyn = VelocityVerlet(atoms, dt=2*ase.units.fs)
  dyn.attach(MDLogger(dyn, atoms, 'md.log', header=False, stress=False,
             peratom=True, mode="a"), interval=1000)

This example will skip the header line and write energies per atom
instead of total energies.  The parameters are

  ``header``: Print a header line defining the columns.

  ``stress``: Print the six components of the stress tensor.

  ``peratom``:  Print energy per atom instead of total energy.

  ``mode``:  If 'a', append to existing file, if 'w' overwrite
  existing file.

Despite appearances, attaching a logger like this does *not* create a
cyclic reference to the dynamics.

.. note::

   If building your own logging class, be sure not to attach the dynamics
   object directly to the logging object. Instead, create a weak reference
   using the ``proxy`` method of the ``weakref`` package. See the
   *ase.md.MDLogger* source code for an example. (If this is not done, a
   cyclic reference may be created which can cause certain calculators
   to not terminate correctly.)


.. autoclass:: MDLogger


Constant NVE simulations (the microcanonical ensemble)
======================================================

Newton's second law preserves the total energy of the system, and a
straightforward integration of Newton's second law therefore leads to
simulations preserving the total energy of the system (E), the number
of atoms (N) and the volume of the system (V).  The most appropriate
algorithm for doing this is velocity Verlet dynamics, since it gives
very good long-term stability of the total energy even with quite
large time steps.  Fancier algorithms such as Runge-Kutta may give
very good short-term energy preservation, but at the price of a slow
drift in energy over longer timescales, causing trouble for long
simulations.

In a typical NVE simulation, the temperature will remain approximately
constant, but if significant structural changes occurs they may result
in temperature changes.  If external work is done on the system, the
temperature is likely to rise significantly.


Velocity Verlet dynamics
------------------------

.. module:: ase.md.verlet

.. autoclass:: VelocityVerlet


``VelocityVerlet`` is the only dynamics implementing the NVE ensemble.
It requires two arguments, the atoms and the time step.  Choosing
a too large time step will immediately be obvious, as the energy will
increase with time, often very rapidly.

Example: See the tutorial :ref:`md_tutorial`.


Constant NVT simulations (the canonical ensemble)
=================================================

Since Newton's second law conserves energy and not temperature,
simulations at constant temperature will somehow involve coupling the
system to a heat bath.  This cannot help being somewhat artificial.
Two different approaches are possible within ASE.  In Langevin
dynamics, each atom is coupled to a heat bath through a fluctuating
force and a friction term.  In Nos√©-Hoover dynamics, a term
representing the heat bath through a single degree of freedom is
introduced into the Hamiltonian.


Langevin dynamics
-----------------

.. module:: ase.md.langevin

.. autoclass:: Langevin

The Langevin class implements Langevin dynamics, where a (small)
friction term and a fluctuating force are added to Newton's second law
which is then integrated numerically.  The temperature of the heat
bath and magnitude of the friction is specified by the user, the
amplitude of the fluctuating force is then calculated to give that
temperature.  This procedure has some physical justification: in a
real metal the atoms are (weakly) coupled to the electron gas, and the
electron gas therefore acts like a heat bath for the atoms.  If heat
is produced locally, the atoms locally get a temperature that is
higher than the temperature of the electrons, heat is transferred to
the electrons and then rapidly transported away by them.  A Langevin
equation is probably a reasonable model for this process.

A disadvantage of using Langevin dynamics is that if significant heat
is produced in the simulation, then the temperature will stabilize at
a value higher than the specified temperature of the heat bath, since
a temperature difference between the system and the heat bath is
necessary to get a finite heat flow.  Another disadvantage is that the
fluctuating force is stochastic in nature, so repeating the simulation
will not give exactly the same trajectory.

When the ``Langevin`` object is created, you must specify a time step,
a temperature (in Kelvin) and a friction.  Typical values for
the friction are 0.01-0.02 atomic units.

::

  # Room temperature simulation
  dyn = Langevin(atoms, 5 * units.fs, 300, 0.002)

Both the friction and the temperature can be replaced with arrays
giving per-atom values.  This is mostly useful for the friction, where
one can choose a rather high friction near the boundaries, and set it
to zero in the part of the system where the phenomenon being studied
is located.


Andersen dynamics
-----------------

.. module:: ase.md.andersen

.. autoclass:: Andersen

The Andersen class implements Andersen dynamics, where constant
temperature is imposed by stochastic collisions with a heat bath.
With a (small) probability (`andersen_prob`) the collisions act
occasionally on velocity components of randomly selected particles
Upon a collision the new velocity is drawn from the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at the corresponding temperature.
The system is then integrated numerically at constant energy
according to the Newtonian laws of motion. The collision probability
is defined as the average number of collisions per atom and timestep.
The algorithm generates a canonical distribution. [1] However, due
to the random decorrelation of velocities, the dynamics are
unphysical and cannot represent dynamical properties like e.g.
diffusion or viscosity. Another disadvantage is that the collisions
are stochastic in nature, so repeating the simulation will not give
exactly the same trajectory.

When the ``Andersen`` object is created, you must specify a time step,
a temperature (in Kelvin) and a collision probability. Typical
values for this probability are in the order of 1e-4 to 1e-1.

  # Room temperature simulation (300 Kelvin, Andersen probability: 0.002)
  dyn = Andersen(atoms, 5 * units.fs, 300, 0.002)

Nos√©-Hoover dynamics
--------------------

In Nos√©-Hoover dynamics, an extra term is added to the Hamiltonian
representing the coupling to the heat bath.  From a pragmatic point of
view one can regard Nos√©-Hoover dynamics as adding a friction term to
Newton's second law, but dynamically changing the friction coefficient
to move the system towards the desired temperature.  Typically the
"friction coefficient" will fluctuate around zero.

Nos√©-Hoover dynamics is not implemented as a separate class, but is a
special case of NPT dynamics.


Berendsen NVT dynamics
-----------------------
.. module:: ase.md.nvtberendsen

.. autoclass:: NVTBerendsen

In Berendsen NVT simulations the velocities are scaled to achieve the desired
temperature. The speed of the scaling is determined by the parameter taut.

This method does not result proper NVT sampling but it usually is
sufficiently good in practice (with large taut). For discussion see
the gromacs manual at www.gromacs.org.

::

SAFIRES boundary method
=======================

.. module:: ase.md.safires

.. class:: SAFIRES(atoms, mdobject, natoms, logfile, traj=None, trajfreq=1, debug=False, barometer=False, surface=False)

SAFIRES (scattering-assisted flexible inner region ensemble separator) is
an algorithm that separates a system into an inner and an outer region
and constraints any interchange between them. SAFIRES is used for coupled
calculations where it is necessary to invoke different computational
methodologies in the inner and outer region.

Simulations using SAFIRES require a model system that is structured in a
specific way. Three parts need to be present, and the tag system is used
to inform SAFIRES which atoms belong to which region:

1) A 'solute'. The solute is the anchor point for SAFIRES with which the
   location of the boundary is calculated. The solute can be a particle
   or molecule, or it can be a periodic surface. The solute is not
   required to be of the same chemical species as the inner or outer
   region particles or molecules. The solute is assigned ``atom.tag = 0``.
2) The 'inner region'. Particles or molecules directly in contact with
   the solute. Typically (but not necessarily), the inner region
   contains fewer particles than the outer region. Only one species
   of particles or molecules can be present in the inner region, and
   this species must be identical to the one present in the outer
   region. Inner region particles or molecules are assigned
   ``atom.tag = 1``.
3) The 'outer region'. Particles or molecules without direct contact
   with the solute but sharing an interface with the inner region.
   Particles or molecules in the outer region must be identical to
   those present in the inner region. Outer region particles or
   molecules are assigned ``atom.tag = 2``.

SAFIRES resolves boundary events through elastic collisions between the
involved pair of outer and inner region particles. The boundary serves
as a mediator for the collision so that particles do not need to be
in actual physical contact.

In order to match the exact moment that a collision occurs, SAFIRES
can scale the time step. A modified propagator is
implemented in SAFIRES which handles such multiple-time-step
propagations while conserving energy and forces. The propagator
reduces to the :class:`Langevin` propagator for constant time steps
and to the :class:`VelocityVerlet` propagator for  constant time steps
and zero friction.

The SAFIRES class uses the following parameters:

*atoms*:
    The list of atoms.

*mdobject*:
    The MD object used for the simulation; either
    :class:`~ase.md.verlet.VelocityVerlet` or
    :class:`~ase.md.langevin.Langevin`.

*natoms*:
    Number of atoms in inner / outer region particles or molecules.
    ``natoms = 1`` indicates that monoatomic particles are present.
    Set ``natoms = 3`` if water is used for example.

*logfile*:
    Custom file name for log file. Default: "safires.log".
    SAFIRES writes a custom logile containing additional information
    about the position of the boundary for each iteration.
    The :class:`~ase/md/MDLogger` still needs to be appended to the MD
    object to log results not specific to SAFIRES. Pass "None" to
    suppress output. 

*debug*:
    Enable writing of verbose debug output at each iteration into
    'debug.log'. Default: False.

*barometer*:
    Enable pseudo-barometer which will count the number of boundary
    events triggered by inner and outer region particles, respectively.
    This can help to identify artifical pressure in the system.
    Barometer uses the direction of the velocity vector relative to the
    solute. Default: False.

*surface*:
    Activate if the used solute is a periodic surface. This will change
    the shape of the boundary from a sphere to a plane in *xy* direction
    and alter the associated distance calculations and elastic
    collisions.

.. note::
    Current limitations of SAFIRES:

    - The :class:`Langevin` parameter ``fixcm`` cannot be True with
      SAFIRES and will be automatically turned off if activated.
    - SAFIRES currently only supports :class:`VelocityVerlet` (NVE) and
      :class:`Langevin` (NVT) dynamics.
    - The solute needs to be fixed using a constraint. If the solute is
      a molecule or surface rather than a monoatomic particle, all atoms
      need to be fixed (center of mass needs to be static).
    - Periodic surface model systems need to have the vacuum in *z*
      direction. Stepped surface or surfaces models whose surface are
      not parallel to the *xy* plane have not been tested and are
      likely to break since the boundary will be constructed parallel
      to the *xy* plane.
